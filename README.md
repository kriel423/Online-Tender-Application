# Online-Tender-Application
A web application framework for the management and application works contracts through the Tender application process.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tender process requires that the client of an identified project solicits the services of a suitable candidate to 
execute the works that will meet the needs of the client. A Tender document in short, is a document requesting information
related to the companies operations applying for the work. Additionally, the Tender describes the nature of the work to be
completed and requests the applicant to provide their cost to complete the work identified by the client.

In this case, the client is a Government Agency, as these industries make use of the Tender process to ensure that the 
process is fair and transparent. The Government Agency compiles a Tender document seeking the services of Consultants to 
complete a Contractual Project. Let's consider a Road Construction Project as an example. The following list indicates the
outline of the process and the tasks that are required to be completed.

## Road Construction Project Outline:

* Agency Identifies a need to be addressed (i.e. Bad Road Condition, Potholes, Bad Line of Sight)
* Agency Creates a Project Scope soliciting the services of Qualified Professionals (Tender Document)
* Suitable companies apply for the work identified, indicating their pricing for completing the work.
* All companies seeking to complete the work are evaluated according to specific eligibility criteria.
* The top five companies are listed in order of most suitable to least suitable for completion of the works.
* The preferred applicant is selected and provided with a letter of award.

The main component of this project, is the method of assessment that this project intends to solve. The problem can be stated
as follows:

>Consultants provide their pricing for completing the project identified by the client. The client identifies, on average, between
100 to 200 projects annually. Each project thereafter recieves more than 30 applications per project. This means that the client
recieves 3000 to 6000 different applications per year, which is required to be manually checked and evaluated. This is a process that
uses a lot of resources and takes an incredible amount of time to complete. Developing this app could potentially save Millions of Rands
in time saving and allocating resources to tasks that require more attention.

## General Outline of Project

The project will consist of the following tasks:

* User and Client Authentication.
* User Profile creation with ability to upload information.
* Chat functionality between Consultant and Client Representative.

* Evaluation of a group of submissions to determine suitable client. 
* Ability to Post Information to Public Networks (Specifically the website of the Client).
